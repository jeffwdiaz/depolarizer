# Depolarizer

## Problem Statement

Our society is facing a growing crisis of division and distrust, fueled in part by the emotionally charged content that dominates our news landscape. Millennials and older Americans, who are active participants in our democracy, are constantly bombarded with news that evokes anger, fear, hatred, and outrage. This constant barrage of negativity makes it difficult for them to form balanced, well-informed opinions and engage in constructive dialogue. The potential impact of addressing this problem is huge. By providing access to neutral, emotion-free news, we can promote a more informed and rational public discourse, foster greater understanding and empathy between different groups, and ultimately strengthen our democracy.
